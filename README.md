## Features 


__1. A Way to keep Score__

*Why?*

Clicky Game is essentially a memory game -a game that can help those who have memory problems to track and improve their skills. So keeping score can be really helpful.

*How?*

Keeping a running score in react isn't very different from vanilla javascript because we want to track what is clicked and do a comparison. If the image hasn't een clicked yet, we want to add to it. If it has then the game is over and the score needs to be reset
